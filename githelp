Branches
if you see this:
fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.
Did you intend to checkout 'origin/style_cleanup' which can not be resolved as commit?o

do this:
Well first, it seems that you didn't fetch the branches.

Use git branch -a instead of git remote show origin.

If the test branch is missing, then do git fetch --all.

Now if you want to checkout a remote branch as a local branch with the same name, just do git checkout BRANCH_NAME, it will be automatically set up to track the origin.
